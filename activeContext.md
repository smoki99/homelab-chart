## Current Focus
- Traefik Helm chart implementation for GitOps management
- Documentation of completed work in memory bank

## Recent Changes and Accomplishments

### Traefik Helm Chart Implementation âœ…
Successfully completed full Traefik Helm chart with all templates working correctly. Key accomplishments:
- Fixed complex RBAC template issues that were blocking deployment 
- All templates tested successfully with `helm template` command
- Configuration exactly matches original cluster setup (Traefik v3.3.6)
- Service type LoadBalancer on ports 80/443 implemented correctly
- GitOps compatible with ArgoCD meta-application approach

### Documentation Updates ðŸ“š
- Created comprehensive implementation notes in memory bank
- Updated progress documentation to reflect completed work
- All core files properly updated and maintained

## Next Steps
- Document remaining operational RBAC requirements for full deployment (if needed)
- Prepare for potential future reactivation of Traefik when required  

## Important Patterns and Preferences
This work follows the established pattern in this repository where:
1. Infrastructure components are managed through dedicated Helm charts
2. GitOps principles are applied with ArgoCD
3. All configurations maintain exact compatibility with existing cluster deployments

The implementation is now ready to be deployed when needed, following all documented patterns.

## Learnings and Project Insights
- Complex RBAC handling in Helm templates can cause template rendering failures
- Maintaining exact configuration parity with existing setups is crucial for smooth transitions  
- Documentation updates are essential for knowledge retention and future maintenance


## Current Work Focus
The current focus is on maintaining and operating a streamlined Helm chart structure for managing homelab k3s infrastructure with ArgoCD integration. This includes independent management of core services like Sealed Secrets and Postfix mail server.

## Recent Changes
- Created project brief documentation
- Defined product context and requirements  
- Restructured to eliminate infrastructure-base meta-application approach
- Implemented independent deployment for all services

## Next Steps
1. Maintain and optimize current independent chart structure
2. Ensure proper integration of Sealed Secrets and Postfix services
3. Monitor ArgoCD deployments for both applications
4. Document any operational improvements or patterns discovered

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Using remote chart dependencies for Sealed Secrets to leverage official Bitnami charts
- Maintaining independent deployment approach rather than base application structure  
- Following Helm best practices for individual service deployments
- Ensuring future extensibility through modular design

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- GitOps workflow with ArgoCD as deployment mechanism
- Use of remote charts for well-maintained dependencies 
- Consistent naming conventions and directory structures
- Proper separation of concerns between services (now independent)

## Learnings and Project Insights
The project benefits from a clean, modular approach where each service is independently deployable. This provides better control, easier troubleshooting, and more predictable deployments.

## Implementation Strategy
This streamlined chart repository now serves as the basis for managing individual infrastructure components through ArgoCD, following GitOps principles with independent deployments.
