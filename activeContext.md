# Active Context: homelab-chart

## Current Work Focus
The current focus is on maintaining and operating a streamlined Helm chart structure for managing homelab k3s infrastructure with ArgoCD integration. This includes independent management of core services like Sealed Secrets and Postfix mail server.

## Recent Changes
- Created project brief documentation
- Defined product context and requirements  
- Restructured to eliminate infrastructure-base meta-application approach
- Implemented independent deployment for all services

## Next Steps
1. Maintain and optimize current independent chart structure
2. Ensure proper integration of Sealed Secrets and Postfix services
3. Monitor ArgoCD deployments for both applications
4. Document any operational improvements or patterns discovered

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Using remote chart dependencies for Sealed Secrets to leverage official Bitnami charts
- Maintaining independent deployment approach rather than base application structure  
- Following Helm best practices for individual service deployments
- Ensuring future extensibility through modular design

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- GitOps workflow with ArgoCD as deployment mechanism
- Use of remote charts for well-maintained dependencies 
- Consistent naming conventions and directory structures
- Proper separation of concerns between services (now independent)

## Learnings and Project Insights
The project benefits from a clean, modular approach where each service is independently deployable. This provides better control, easier troubleshooting, and more predictable deployments.

## Implementation Strategy
This streamlined chart repository now serves as the basis for managing individual infrastructure components through ArgoCD, following GitOps principles with independent deployments.
