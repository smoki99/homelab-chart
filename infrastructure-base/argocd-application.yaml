  # This application acts as a meta-application that orchestrates infrastructure services
  # It manages the relationship between sealed-secrets and postfix applications through ArgoCD dependencies
  # Actual deployments are handled by their own independent ArgoCD applications:
  # - sealed-secrets (https://github.com/smoki99/homelab-chart/tree/main/sealed-secrets)
  # - postfix (https://github.com/smoki99/homelab-chart/tree/main/postfix)
  
  # Dependencies ensure proper deployment order and relationship management
  dependencies:
    - name: sealed-secrets
    - name: postfix
