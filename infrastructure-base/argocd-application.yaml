  # This application acts as a meta-application that generates ArgoCD Application manifests for child services
  # It manages the relationship between sealed-secrets and postfix applications through generated manifests
  # Actual deployments are handled by the ArgoCD Applications generated from this chart:
  # - sealed-secrets (generated manifest)
  # - postfix (generated manifest)
  
  # Dependencies are now managed through Helm template generation rather than direct ArgoCD dependencies
