# Progress: homelab-chart

## What Works
- All core memory bank documentation files have been created successfully
- Project brief, product context, active context, system patterns, and tech context are all established
- Foundation for the Helm chart structure is in place

## What's Left to Build
1. Main Helm chart structure creation
2. Sealed Secrets chart integration from Bitnami
3. Postfix server deployment implementation
4. ArgoCD application manifest setup

## Current Status
The documentation foundation is complete and ready. The next step is to create the actual Helm chart structure with all required components.

## Known Issues
None at this time - project is proceeding according to plan.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Decision to use remote charts for Sealed Secrets was confirmed as best practice
- Multi-service approach in a single base chart was chosen for simplicity
- GitOps workflow with ArgoCD remains the core deployment strategy

## Next Steps
Create the Helm chart structure and implement the core functionality according to requirements.
